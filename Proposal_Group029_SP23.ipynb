        "\n",
        "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
        "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
        "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
        "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
        "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

        "We prefer MAE over different metrics such as mean-squared error (MSE), which takes the sum of squared residuals over the number of datapoints. MAE will be more robust to players who qualify as outliers and are predicted to have larger salaries relative to the rest of the cohort, as the possibly large difference between a fitted model's predicted value and true value would be less influential in the total error of the model. On the other hand, MSE would give less optimistic estimations of model performance from the difference between an outlier salary and its prediction being squared. More practically, however, MAE would also be preferred given that the intended units of the model's input and output includes dollars. It would be easier to interpret a model applied to this specific problem and its performance in terms of absolute error of allocated money, instead of the square of residual money error."

        "Our project's discussion of ethics begin with the problem we are attempting to address. We first recognize that assigning monetary value based on an athlete's performance in a specific game with specific rules and regulations is prima facie a difficult task. On the other hand, we must also recognize that exploring such a question is permissible in the first place due to the consent that MLB players give when they agree to their contracts to play, which allows for having individual in-game performance measured, collected, and evaluated to negotiate future salaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "We must also address the ethics pertaining to the data we are using in the first place. Given that the datasets and information gathered to use in our project are all made publicly available to the public through MLB and other organizations, we we find no ethical concerns for using the data that we obtain for our project. Much of this player statistics and news about player salaries has been present for decades in the time period of the Internet, with an increasing demand for more access. Older sources will also be used to gather additonal data from news articles reporting player salaries into a self-created spreadsheet. We will cite any and all datasets used; that way anyone outside of the project is able to view the data we used directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "One objection that could be raised is that our data should be used  without names or other personally identifiable information (PII) for the sake of privacy to the individual players. We do not find this proposition convincing given that the knowledge about what salary is paid to which player is made publicly available anyways, and the lack of clarity from eliminating PII leads to some obscurity about how well a model can accurately predict salary. Also, MLB players are professional athletes and thus qualify as public figures, making the concern for salary associated to one's name a subpar objection.\n",
        "\n",
        "We conclude by stating our intentions: to be reasonable in our predictions that indicate just compensation on the part of the player and the team. We suggest that some of the players in arbitration- those that are statistically among the best- may be getting underpaid relative to players under long-term contracts due to their status being under arbitration as opposed to an unrestricted free agent. Therefore, we are equally concerned of arriving at salary predicitions fair that give good estimate of player's salaries, while also being mindful of  the rules of arbitration mentioned in our background section that greatly influence the process and outcomes of salary arbitration. Any discussion about the rules of arbitration and how that may have an unjust impact on specific player's salaries is not within the scope of our project."
